# NFS
We create an AWS EFS and mount it with NFS to use as the users' home directories.
This gives the users persistent storage within their Docker containers.
The EFS must be mounted on both the Jupyterhub/Docker swarm manager instance, and all Docker swarm worker instances.

1. On the AMI we used, `nfs-utils` is already installed.
   Otherwise, `sudo yum install nfs-utils` to install an NFS client.

2. We need to create a security group that opens up TCP 2409 inside the VPC, which is used by NFS clients.
   We're currently running security groups that are open on all ports inside the VPC.(could you explain where this security group is?)

3. Now create a new EFS.(leave everything on default?)

4. [EFS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mount-fs-auto-mount-onreboot.html) gives us the mount command to use and also an entry for `/etc/fstab`.
   Put the following in `/etc/fstab`(on which instance?):

   ```
   ${mount-target-DNS}:/ ${efs-mount-point} nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 0 0
   ```

   FS gives a `mount-target-DNS` that's something like `fs-XXXXXXX.efs.REGION.amazonaws.com`.
   We use `/mnt/nfs/home` for `efs-mount-point`.
   When the we run the Docker containers running Jupyter notebooks, we bind `/mnt/nfs/home` to `/home` inside the containers.


5. Create the mount point, mount the EFS, and restart the Docker daemon.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/home/
   sudo mount /mnt/nfs/home/
   sudo service docker restart
   ```
